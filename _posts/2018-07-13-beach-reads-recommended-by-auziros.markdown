Lumen is part wartime political intrigue, detective story, psychological thriller, and religious mystery, and follows a German army captain and a Chicago priest as they investigate the death of a nun in Nazi-occupied Poland — but mostly it's a timely read about  conflict between institutional loyalty and personal integrity." referred_by="Jeremy Freeland, General Counsel (Leavenworth, Wash., USA)" referrer_url="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-freeland-108b5b1/" %}

It's a fast-paced, sensationalistic read - sometimes a little over-the-top, but recommended if you enjoy a good escapist novel from time to time." referred_by="Lewis Carpenter, CMO (Bellevue, Wash., USA)" referrer_url="https://twitter.com/lewiscarpenter" %}

Tina Brown was Editor of Vanity Fair, the New Yorker and founded the Daily Beast. Although ostensibly a memoir based on her diaries, it reads like a novel. I enjoyed her depiction of an ambitious young Brit making her name in the US." referred_by="Aoife Crowley, Customer Success Manager EMEA (London, UK)" referrer_url="https://twitter.com/aoifacrowley" %}
