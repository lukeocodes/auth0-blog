**BELLEVUE, Wash. -- August 13, 2018 --** [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), a global leader in Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS), today announced that it has been selected by [Naranja](https://www.naranja.com/), the largest credit card issuer in Argentina, as the sole identity and authentication platform for a wide range of new financial services, including bill pay, online account access, and mobile payments. 

As a leading financial services provider in Argentina, Naranja – along with Naranja VISA, Naranja MasterCard, and Naranja American Express – services more than five million consumers and 260,000 merchants for credit card and e-commerce services. With a mission of consumer connection through technology innovation, Naranja implemented a series of new APIs to accelerate the adoption of several new digital channels and needed an end-to-end identity platform. Auth0’s Universal Identity Platform will be standardized across all new apps. 

“In evaluating several leading identity platforms, it was clear that Auth0 was the most flexible and able to handle the diverse set of requirements for the Naranja API ecosystem that includes our internal apps, digital channels, and partner integrations,” said Javier Voos, Lead Architect at Naranja. “Another major selling point is that Auth0 can keep pace with the aggressive timeline that our digital transformation demands.”

“The potential reach of Naranja’s digital app rollout is astounding and something we’re very excited to be part of,” said Eugenio Pace, CEO and Co-founder of Auth0. “Flexibility and the ability to scale easily to tens of millions of users are foundational principles of our platform. Given the growth and breadth of Naranja’s use cases, we anticipate widespread growth across Latin America, and are honored to serve as the core identity platform across these new services.”

As financial service organizations modernize their offerings to suit the needs of today’s consumer, they realize the importance of a comprehensive identity platform to maximize customer experience, personalize interaction, and create a single view of the customer across every touchpoint. This is why they’re increasingly turning to Auth0. For more information on Auth0 in this sector, please visit: [https://auth0.com/financial-services](https://auth0.com/financial-services).
