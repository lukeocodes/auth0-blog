Want to know what it takes to be a successful woman in infosec?

Join us at [Women Who Code Portland’s Networking Night](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Portland/events/253324140/) on Thursday, Aug. 16 from 5 - 8:30 p.m. to hear what this group of notable women have to say about how they got into InfoSec, what their roles are like, and advice for someone breaking into the field. (Special thanks to sponsor [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/).) The panel will include:

- **Joan Pepin** , Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and VP Operations, Auth0
- **LJ Johnson** , Sr. Director, Information Security, Nike
- **Miki Demeter** , Security Researcher, Intel
- **Moderator:** Ann Wallace, Technical Cloud Consultant, Google

Recently, Joan expanded her Auth0 CISO role, adding VP of Operations to her title. As a preview, we asked her to offer some leadership advice for people stretching into new roles:
