**BELLEVUE, Wash. -- June 4, 2018 --** [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), a global leader in Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS), today announced that its Universal Identity Platform has been selected by [GoodLife Fitness](https://www.goodlifefitness.com), the largest health club company in Canada, for identity management and authentication across its consumer-facing mobile app, as well as internally for its GoodLife associates. 

GoodLife Fitness, the fourth largest fitness chain in the world, operates more than 400 health clubs across Canada and serves more than 1.5 million customers. With its continuously growing member base, GoodLife was in need of an identity solution that could make the user experience easy and secure on its Member website and mobile app. In addition to its externally-facing product, the company was also in need of authentication for its internal GoodLife Associate System, which services more than 12,000 employees across Canada.  

“Ensuring a positive member experience for every interaction with our brand, both in our health clubs and digitally, is extremely important to us,” said Jonathan Fagg, Digital Marketing Manager, GoodLife Fitness. “Being able to standardize on a single identity platform for internal and external use will make it seamless when we add new products and services for our members and employees.” 

Auth0 provides a Universal Identity Platform that enables enterprises to manage the identities for different audiences (consumers, business partners, employees, IoT devices) at once. This hybrid approach is being rapidly adopted as an efficient strategy to converge platforms and eliminate the hassle of managing multiple identity vendors. 

“The way GoodLife Fitness is using Auth0 is a great example of how adaptable our platform is for various authentication needs,” said Eugenio Pace, CEO and Co-founder of Auth0. “GoodLife Fitness is consistently recognized as a company that manages its members and staff extremely well. We look forward to being their identity platform as they continue to expand their wide-reaching network.”
