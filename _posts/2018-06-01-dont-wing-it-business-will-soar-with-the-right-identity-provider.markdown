The online travel sector has really taken off in the last decade. The importance of trust and reputation has never been more important for high flying travel businesses. These reputations will sink pretty quickly with a data breach involving personal data.

[Digital transformation](http://deloitte.wsj.com/cio/2016/06/27/apis-help-drive-digital-transformation/) is really helped by APIs. Their ability to abstract data structure from interface requirements provides application developers really powerful tools to develop bigger and better software. 

The travel sector is no different, with big players introducing APIs early on. This gave them time to hone them to the benefit of integrators and partners, learn how to write documentation and build them on resilient infrastructure.

One area where the travel sector still has to improve is on the security of their users data and their security practices. According to a recent study by Dashlane sound that [89%](https://blog.dashlane.com/travel-password-power-rankings-2018/) of travel sites have unsafe password practices.

The [worst offenders](https://auth0.com/blog/the-best-and-worst-travel-sites-at-keeping-your-info-safe) may not even use some of the most common safe password practices, like minimum characters and password strength evaluation.
