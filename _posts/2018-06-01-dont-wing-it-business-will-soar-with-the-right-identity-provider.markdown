The travel sector has really taken off in the last decade. The importance of trust and reputation has never been more important for high flying travel businesses. Travel has been at the forefront of a [digital transformation](https://www.kcom.com/connected-thinking/opinion/the-digital-transformation-of-the-travel-and-tourism-industry/) and organisations are facing challenges where their customers expect a seamless experience, both on the web and on mobile applications. Application programming interfaces (APIs) enable controlled interaction between different platforms, processes and functions of a business. It can do this in a secure way, providing integration between companies and their suppliers, or companies and clients (users on websites and mobile applications).

> _“Digitisation represents an exciting opportunity for the aviation, travel and tourism ecosystem, with the potential to unlock $1trillion of value to the industry and wider society over the next decade (2016 – 2025)”_ —[World Economic Forum](http://reports.weforum.org/digital-transformation/wp-content/blogs.dir/94/mp/files/pages/files/wef-dti-aviation-travel-and-tourism-white-paper.pdf)

Demand on the travel sector has reached an all time high. Digital transformation is necessary to keep up with the steep demand for enhanced customer experience and lower prices. Emerging markets and buying power is pushing the need for better integrations between products, suppliers, retailers and consumers.

Travel organisations are increasingly building APIs to better support their digital transformation efforts; many of these can be monetized and shared with partners and competitors, further bolstering their commercial position within their [business ecosystems](http://deloitte.wsj.com/cio/2015/09/02/ecosystems-expand-the-art-of-the-possible/). 

## Different types of APIs in the travel sector

There are many types of APIs in the travel sector including but not limited to hotels, airlines, vehicle rental, reviews and rating, packages, tours, attractions, and public transport.

### Hotel reservations

You're spoilt for choice for availability APIs, as online travel agencies stumble over themselves to give you the most options and best prices. Priceline and Expedia are the two big players in this area. Expedia's model is particularly interesting, offering two services that directly compliment each other. The Expedia Partner Central and Expedia Affiliate Network (EAN).
 
Expedia Partner Central's Connectivity APIs are built to streamline the inventory update. Booking availability, retrieval, and notifications can all handled through APIs that help hotels automate bookings by instantly updating property availability. The product management API allows hotels to instantly send any edits about room types and configurations ensuring that hotel inventory is always accurate.

The EAN API provides access for online travel agencies that want to incorporate booking into their own sites and applications. From availability searches, bookings, itineraries, and cancellations, EAN is a complete toolbox for online travel agencies.

### Air fares and availability

Air fare APIs like Skyscanner provide two search types for availability.

*Flex* searches are less specific searches that can be used when searching for general availability.

*Real-time* searches provide accurate pricing and availability requires more advanced search metrics, like exact routes and times. They're most powerful for real-time price comparison of times and routes.

The two compliment each other nicely, where the real-time search can be used to drill down onto results from a flex search.

### Car rental

Rentalcars.com and CarCrawler dominate this space, with great API offerings. 

Rentalcars Connect affiliate program gives you access to many globally recognised car rental companies. Part of the Priceline group, their API is as complete and well built as any you'd expect to see from Booking.com. So similar to other Priceline models, Rentalcars has both a B2C site, and a B2B API offering.

In contrast to Rentalcars which offers an affiliate program, CarCrawler is a true B2B offering. It provides APIs and management services for car rentals, buses, chauffeur, rail and taxi-transfer solutions.

### Reviews and rating

The TripAdvisor Content API absolutely dominates this space. It's API is B2B and it's used to augment businesses pages with reviews, rating, descriptions, attractions, and things to do nearby.

### Global distribution systems (GDSs)

Global distribution systems offer comprehensive booking and reservation management for multiple areas of the travel sector. Integrating with many of the B2B services mentioned above like air fares, car rentals, hotel reservations, as well as railway tickets and cruises. Offering their own B2B solutions they aggregate APIs into one easy to use service.

## Jet powered authentication with Auth0

The Auth0 Authentication API exposes authentication functionality including supported identity protocols such as OpenID Connect, OAuth, and SAML. Typically, you would consume this API through one of the Auth0 SDKs.

- automated competitor analysis through lost keys
- api auth provides b2c analytics on b2b apis

## Conclusion

Rapid digital transformation with Auth0, etc.

One area where the travel sector still has to improve is on the security of their users data and their security practices. According to a recent study by Dashlane sound that [89%](https://blog.dashlane.com/travel-password-power-rankings-2018/) of travel sites have unsafe password practices. The [worst offenders](https://auth0.com/blog/the-best-and-worst-travel-sites-at-keeping-your-info-safe) may not even use some of the most common safe password practices, like minimum characters and password strength evaluation.
