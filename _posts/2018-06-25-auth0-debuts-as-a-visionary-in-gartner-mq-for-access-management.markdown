**BELLEVUE, Wash. -- June 19, 2018 --** [_Auth0_](https://auth0.com/), a global leader in Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS), today announced that it has been named as a Visionary by Gartner in its June 2018 Magic Quadrant (MQ) for Access Management. Positioning is based on completeness of vision and ability to execute.

“We appreciate Gartner’s evolving perspective on the Access Management landscape and their willingness to acknowledge Auth0 as a Visionary,” said Eugenio Pace, CEO and Co-founder of Auth0. “We are excited about our placement as a Visionary and consider it a milestone to land here in our first year participating in the process.”

Auth0 was founded in 2013 as a Universal Identity Platform that provides developers with extensibility, flexibility, and programmatic integration with identity into applications. From the company’s inception, Auth0 was created as an identity platform designed to handle the rigors of any possible use case: B2B, B2C, or B2E. Its universality has provided global enterprises with the ease of managing all identity through one single platform.
